# Apple Sign In for Xamarin.Forms

This repository contains a sample Xamarin.Forms (iOS, Android, UWP) app which demonstrates how to implement Apple Sign In, as well as an Azure Functions project which is required for non-iOS13+ platforms, and a library project which contains the code for handling Apple Sign In's OpenID/OAuth calls.

 - XamarinFormsAppleSignIn - Sample Xamarin.Forms project using DependencyService pattern for calling Apple Sign In flows (native iOS 13+ sign in API's and OAuth/OpenID for the other platforms)
 - AppleSignInAzureFunction - Azure Functions for generating Apple Sign In Authorization URL and handling sign in callback from Apple
 - Xamarin.AppleSignIn - Library project containing code to handle the OAuth/OpenID flow for Apple Sign In


# Apple Developer Setup

First of all you need to set up a few things in Apple's Developer portal, in the [Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/) section.

## Setup Apple Sign In Domain

First of all you will need to register your domain name and verify it with Apple in the [More](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/services/list) section of the _Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles_ portal, by clicking **Configure**.

Add your domain and click **Register**

![Register your Domain](Images/readme-signin-domain-configure.png)

> NOTE: If you see an error about your domain not being _SPF Compliant_, you will need to add a _SPF_ DNS TXT Record to your domain and wait for it to propogate before continuing:
>
> The SPF TXT may look something like this:
> ```
> v=spf1 a a:myapp.com -all
> ```

Next you will need to verify ownership of the domain by clicking **Download** to download the `apple-developer-domain-association.txt` file, and uploading that file to the `.well-known/` folder of your website, for the given domain.

Once your `.well-known/apple-developer-domain-association.txt` file is uploaded, and reachable at your site's url, you can click **Verify** to have Apple verify your domain ownership.

> NOTE: Apple will verify ownership with `https://`, so ensure you have SSL setup and the file is accessible through a secure URL.

You will need to successfully complete this process before continuing to the next Setup section.

## Setup your App ID

In the [Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list) section, create a new identifier, and choose **App IDs**.  If you already have an App ID, choose to edit it instead.

![Create a new App ID](Images/readme-appid-create.png)

Enable **Sign In with Apple**.  You will most likely want to use the **Enable as primary App ID** option.
![Enable Sign In with Apple](Images/readme-appid-signin.png)

Save your App ID changes.

## Create a Server ID

Next, in the [Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/serviceId) section, create a new identifier, and this time choose **Service IDs**

![Create a new Service ID](Images/readme-serviceid-create.png)

Give your Services ID a description, and an identifier.  This identifier will be your `ServerId` later on.  Make sure you enable **Sign In with Apple**.

Before continuing, click **Configure** next to the _Sign In with Apple_ option you enabled.

In the configuration panel, ensure the correct **Primary App ID** is selected.

Next, choose the **Web Domain** you configured previously.

Finally, add one ore more **Return URLs**.  Any `redirect_uri` you use later must be registered here exactly as you use it.  Make sure you include the `http://` or `https://` in the URL when you enter it.

> NOTE: For testing purposes, you cannot use `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`, but you can use other domains such as `local.test`.  If you choose to do this, you can edit your machine's `hosts` file to resolve this fictitious domain to your local IP address.

![Configure your Apple Sign In](Images/readme-serviceid-configure.png)

Save your changes when your are finished.


## Create a Key for your Services ID

In the [Keys](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list) section, create a new **Key**.

Give you key a name, and enable **Sign In with Apple**.

![Create a new Key](Images/readme-key-create.png)

Click **Configure** beside _Sign In with Apple_.

Ensure the correct **Primary App ID** is selected and click **Save**.

Click **Continue** and then **Register** to create your new key.

Next, you will only have one chance to download the key you just generated.  Click **Download**.

![Download Key](Images/readme-key-download.png)

Also, take note of your **Key ID** at this step.  This will be used for your `KeyId` later on.

You will have downloaded a `.p8` key file.  You can open this file in Notepad, or VSCode to see the text contents.  They should look something like:

```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIGTAgEAMBMGBasGSM49AgGFCCqGSM49AwEHBHkwdwIBAQQg3MX8n6VnQ2WzgEy0
Skoz9uOvatLMKTUIPyPCAejzzUCgCgYIKoZIzj0DAQehRANCAARZ0DoM6QPqpJxP
JKSlWz0AohFhYre10EXPkjrih4jTm+b0AeG2BGuoIWd18i8FimGDgK6IzHHPsEqj
DHF5Svq0
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Keep this key in a safe place.  We will use it later as the `P8FileContents`.


# Using Apple Sign In in your App

## iOS 13+

In iOS 13 and newer, Apple has native API's to help Authenticate users with Apple Sign In.

The [AppleSignInServiceiOS.cs](XamarinFormsAppleSignIn\XamarinFormsAppleSignIn.iOS\Services\AppleSignInServiceiOS.cs) file demonstrates how to use the native API's.

## Android, UWP, and older iOS versions

Apple also supports a version of OpenID/OpenAuth for other platforms.


# Sample Apple Sign In Flow

This sample offers an opinionated implementation for getting Apple Sign In to work in your Xamarin.Forms app.

We use two Azure Functions to help with the authentication flow:

1. `applesignin_auth` - Generates the Apple Sign In Authorization URL and redirects to it.  We do this on the server side, instead of the mobile app, so we can cache the `state` and validate it when Apple's servers send a callback.
2. `applesignin_callback` - Handles the POST callback from Apple and securely exchanges the authorization code for an Access Token and ID Token.  Finally, it redirects back to the App's URI Scheme, passing back the tokens in a URL Fragment.

The mobile app registers itself to handle the custome URI scheme we have selected (in this case `xamarinformsapplesignin://`) so the `applesignin_callback` function can relay the tokens back to it.

When the user initiates authentication, the following steps happen:

1. The mobile app generates a `nonce` and `state` value and passes them to the `applesignin_auth` Azure function.
2. The `applesignin_auth` Azure function generates an Apple Sign In Authorization URL (using the provided `state` and `nonce`), and redirects the mobile app browser to it.
3. The user enters their credentials securely in the Apple Sign In authorization page hosted on Apple's servers.
4. After the Apple Sign In flow finishes on Apple's servers, Apple Redirects to the `redirect_uri` which will be the `applesignin_callback` Azure function.
5. The request from Apple sent to the `applesignin_callback` function is validated to ensure the correct `state` is returned, and that the ID Token claims are valid.
6. The `applesignin_callback` Azure function exchanges the `code` posted to it by Apple, for an _Access Token_, _Refresh Token_, and _ID Token_ (which contains claims about the User ID, Name, and Email).
7. The `applesignin_callback` Azure function finally redirects back to the app's URI scheme (`xamarinformsapplesignin://`) appending a URI fragment with the Tokens (eg: `xamarinformsapplesignin://#access_token=...&refresh_token=...&id_token=...`).
8. The Mobile app parses out the URI Fragment into an `AppleAccount` and validates the `nonce` claim received matches the `nonce` generated at the start of the flow.
9. The mobile app is now authenticated!

# Azure Functions / Server Configuration

This sample uses Azure Functions, but you could just as easily use an ASP.NET Core Controller by copying the simple logic in each of the functions, or even some completely different web server for that matter (but you're on your own to implement those!).

## Configuration
There are several App Settings you will need to configure for your Azure Functions:

- `APPLE_SIGNIN_KEY_ID` - This is your `KeyId` from earlier.
- `APPLE_SIGNIN_TEAM_ID` - This is usually your _Team ID_ found in your [Membership Profile](https://developer.apple.com/account/#/membership)
- `APPLE_SIGNIN_SERVER_ID`: This is the `ServerId` from earlier.  It's *not* your App _Bundle ID_, but rather the *Identifier* of the *Services ID* you created.
- `APPLE_SIGNIN_APP_CALLBACK_URI` - This is the custom URI Scheme you want to redirect back to your app with.  In this sample `xamarinformsapplesignin://` is used.
- `APPLE_SIGNIN_REDIRECT_URI` - The *Redirect URL* you setup when creating your *Services ID* in the *Apple Sign In* Configuration section.  To test, it might look something like: `http://local.test:7071/api/applesignin_callback`
- `APPLE_SIGNIN_P8_KEY` - The text contents of your `.p8` file, with all the `\n` newlines removed so it's one long string

# Security Notes

First of all, it is very important that you should **never** store your P8 key inside of your application code.  Your application code is easy to download and disassemble.  Placing your private p8 key value inside your app should be considered about as safe as posting it publicly.

It is also considered a bad practice to use a `WebView` to host the authentication flow, and to intercept URL Navigation events to obtain the authorization code.

There is currently no secure way to handle the Apple Sign In flow on non iOS13+ devices/platforms without hosting some code on a server to handle the token exchange.  We also recommend hosting the authorization url generation code on the server so you can cache the state and validate it when Apple POST's a callback to your server.
